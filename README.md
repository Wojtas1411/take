## Project 1 - Films
 - Spring Backend
 - Angular Frontend
### Requirements
 - Angular CLI 9+
 - Java 8/Gradle
### Description [EN]
1. Application works properly only after it is served from spring server (same origin is required for Angular to handle xsrf tokens)
2. Compiled Anglar application should be already placed in `resources/static` directory, so `./gradlew bootRun` should run application just fine
3. Default address is `localhost:8080`
4. For custom build refer to `buildProject` and `runProject` scripts.
